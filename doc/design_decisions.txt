 DESIGN DECISIONS

* brainmix.py should not use a function BrainMix().
  By running the app on the global workspace, we can do introspection of the graphical objects
  during an interactive session (for debugging)

* The module optparse is deprecated
  https://docs.python.org/2/library/optparse.html
  Use argparse instead
