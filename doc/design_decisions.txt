 DESIGN DECISIONS

* We don't use set/get methods if accessing the attribute directly is sufficient.
  For explanations on why this is ok in Python, see:

* Santiago started exploring the possibility of making the application
  with a Model-View-Controller design. See example here:

* Why use the @QtCore.Slot() decorator?
  It seems like it "has the advantage of reducing the amount of memory used and is slightly faster."

* The main script cannot be called brainmix.py (we call it brainmixapp.py instead).
  Because we want to be able to say: from brainmix.core import SOMETHING
  and Python would think you refer to the script, not the brainmix package.

* The main script (brainmix.py) should not use a function BrainMix().
  By running the app on the global workspace, we can do introspection of the graphical objects
  during an interactive session (for debugging)

* The module optparse is deprecated
  https://docs.python.org/2/library/optparse.html
  Use argparse instead
